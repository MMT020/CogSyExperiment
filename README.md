# Experiment Instructions

## Overview
This experiment consists of two parts, each taking approximately 5 minutes to complete. You will only need to run the `FullExperiment.py` script. Below are the detailed instructions for both parts.

```python3 fullExperiment.py```

## Part 1: Stickman Reaction
In the first part of the experiment, your task is to react to the appearance of a stickman on the screen. The stickman will appear at random intervals. You must press the spacebar as soon as you see the stickman.

**Note:** The colors on the screen will switch after every iteration.

## Part 2: Player Count Recall
In the second part of the experiment, you will be presented with a series of images, each depicting a different number of players. Your task is to remember the number of players shown in each image and then press the corresponding key on your keyboard that corresponds to the number you remember.
